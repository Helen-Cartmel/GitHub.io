The Bit That's More Me

I'm someone who really cares about the work I do and the people I do it with. I love getting stuck into a project, especially when there's collaboration, creativity, and a sense of purpose.
🤔 Curious
Always asking questions until I get it right. I believe the best learning happens when we truly understand what people need to know, feel, or do.
🎨 Colourful
Literally and figuratively! I bring energy, creativity, and a bit of humour to everything I do. Learning should feel good and get results.
👥 People Person
What really drives me is people - understanding them, supporting them, and creating content that genuinely helps them succeed.
⛷️ Part-Time Ski Instructor

I turned my passion for skiing into a qualification as a BASI Level 1 instructor. Teaching skiing has enhanced my instructional abilities - patience, clear communication, and adapting methods to individual learning styles.

My Values at Work

Loyalty matters: I'll give 110%, but I believe in give-and-take, not burnout.

Clarity helps: I'm at my best when I have a clear picture of what's expected. I like to feel confident and prepared.

Continuous growth: Always looking for new adventures, both literal and creative. From typesetting on early Apple Macs to AI-powered learning - I evolve with the times.
